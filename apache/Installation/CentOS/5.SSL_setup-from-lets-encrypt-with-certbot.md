### Install Certbot and the Apache Plugin  with Snap

Certbot recommends using their snap package for installation. Snap packages work on nearly all Linux distributions. To install `snapd` on your CentOS system, follow these steps:

1. **Install the `snapd` package On Rhel Based Linux**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install snapd
   ```
2. **Install the 'snapd on Amazon Linux:**

Even though the EPEL repository is not available for Amazon Linux 2023, you can still use Fedora repositories as alternatives because AL2023 and Fedora share a close relationship, and EPEL is a part of the Fedora Project.

Create a configuration file for the Fedora 36 repository:

   ```bash
   sudo touch /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo
   sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo
   ```
And write the following code in it:

   ```bash
   [fedora]
   name=Fedora 36 - $basearch
   #baseurl=http://download.example/pub/fedora/linux/releases/36/Everything/$basearch/os/
   metalink=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-36&arch=$basearch
   enabled=1
   metadata_expire=7d
   repo_gpgcheck=0
   type=rpm
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://getfedora.org/static/fedora.gpg
          https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fedora-repos/raw/f36/f/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-36-primary
   skip_if_unavailable=False
   ```
   Now install snapd with following command:
   
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install snapd
   ```

3. **Enable and start the `snapd.socket` systemd unit**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
   ```

4. **Create a symbolic link for classic snap support**:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
   ```

5. **Update the system paths**: 
   Restart your system to ensure the snap paths are updated correctly.

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
   
### Removing Certbot Packages and Installing Certbot Snap

Before installing Certbot via snap, remove any existing Certbot packages installed through your OS package manager. This ensures that the `certbot` command uses the snap version rather than the OS package manager version. The command varies depending on your OS. Here are common examples:
   - For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get remove certbot
     ```
   - For Fedora-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf remove certbot
     ```
   - For CentOS/RHEL-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo yum remove certbot
     ```
---

## Option 1: Install Certbot:

   Install Certbot with the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo snap install --classic certbot
   ```

**Prepare the Certbot Command**

   Create a symbolic link to ensure the `certbot` command is accessible:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
   ```

**Choose How to Run Certbot**

   - **To obtain and install certificates automatically**: Run the following command to get a certificate and automatically configure Apache to use it, enabling HTTPS in one step:
     ```bash
     sudo certbot --apache
     ```

**Note** Before running the above command ensure that the listed domains point to this Apache server are accessible from the internet otherwise the Certificate Authority will be failed to verify the temporary Apache configuration changes made by Certbot. Expected error: ```Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: apache).```

   - **To obtain a certificate only**: If you prefer to manually configure Apache, use this command to get a certificate without automatic configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo certbot certonly --apache
     ```

**Test Automatic Renewal**

   Certbot includes a cron job or systemd timer for automatic certificate renewal. To test if automatic renewal is set up correctly, run:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

   Check the following locations to confirm the renewal process:
   - `/etc/crontab/`
   - `/etc/cron.*/*`
   - `systemctl list-timers`

6. **Verify Certificate Installation**

   Visit `https://yourwebsite.com/` in your browser and look for the lock icon in the URL bar to confirm that your site is using the new certificate.

---
### Step 5: (Optional) Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
Certbot can automatically set up redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, but if you need to do it manually, add the following to your Apache configuration:

1. Open your Apache configuration file for your site. It might be in `/etc/httpd/sites-available/yourdomain.conf` or similar.
2. Add the following:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName yourdomain.com
       ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
       Redirect permanent / https://yourdomain.com/
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

3. Restart Apache to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

Now your site should automatically redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and your SSL certificates will be managed by Let's Encrypt.

## Option 2. Installing Certificates with Standalone Plugin Validation**

The **standalone** plugin is used when Certbot needs to run its own temporary web server to serve the validation challenges. This method doesn't require an existing web server like Apache or Nginx to be running during the validation process. It is ideal for situations where no web server is running or you don’t want to configure virtual hosts.

#### **How It Works**:
- Certbot spins up its own lightweight web server on port 80 (or 443 for HTTPS).
- This server serves the challenge file that the Certificate Authority (CA) uses to verify the domain.
- Once validated, Certbot stops the temporary web server.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Stop your existing web server** (if running) to free up port 80:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop apache2
   ```

2. **Run Certbot with the standalone plugin**:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Restart your web server** after the certificate has been issued:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   ```

#### **Advantages**:
- No need to configure virtual hosts.
- Useful for minimal environments without a web server.
- Doesn’t require changes to your Apache/Nginx configurations.

#### **Drawbacks**:
- Requires stopping your web server temporarily, which may cause downtime.
- Not suitable if other services are using port 80 or 443.

## Option 3. Installing Certificates with Webroot Plugin Validation**

The **webroot** plugin is a method where Certbot places a special challenge file in a directory of your website (inside `.well-known/acme-challenge`) and the CA visits your website to check for the existence of this file. This method doesn’t require stopping your web server and can run while your website remains online.

#### **How It Works**:
- Certbot creates the necessary challenge files inside the `.well-known/acme-challenge/` directory within your web root.
- The CA checks for the file via HTTP on your domain.
- If the file is correctly served, validation succeeds.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create the webroot directory** if it doesn’t already exist:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /var/www/yourdomain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge
   ```

2. **Run Certbot using the webroot plugin**:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/yourdomain.com -d yourdomain.com
   ```

   - The `-w` flag specifies the webroot directory where the challenge file will be placed.

3. **Certbot completes the validation** by placing the challenge file in the webroot, and the CA verifies the file.

#### **Advantages**:
- No downtime—your website remains live during the process.
- No need to stop or interfere with your running web server.
- Suitable for servers that are already serving web content.

#### **Drawbacks**:
- Requires proper webroot configuration.
- If multiple domains are hosted, you need to specify the correct webroot for each domain.

## Option 4. Installing Certificates with DNS-01 Challenge Validation**

The **DNS-01 challenge** is a more advanced method that involves proving domain ownership by creating a specific DNS TXT record. The CA will query the DNS system to verify the presence of this TXT record.

#### **How It Works**:
- Certbot provides you with a value to add as a DNS TXT record in your domain’s DNS settings.
- Once the TXT record is propagated across DNS servers, the CA queries it to confirm ownership.

#### **Steps**:
1. **Run Certbot using the manual DNS challenge**:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges=dns -d yourdomain.com
   ```

2. Certbot will prompt you to create a DNS TXT record with a specified value.

3. **Log into your DNS provider** (e.g., Namecheap, Cloudflare) and create a TXT record under your domain with the value provided by Certbot.

4. After creating the record, **wait for DNS propagation**. You can use tools like [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net) to check if the TXT record has propagated.

5. Certbot will validate the DNS record once it propagates and issue the certificate.

#### **Advantages**:
- Can be used for domains that don’t serve content on port 80/443 or aren’t hosted on a server.
- Ideal for wildcard certificates (`*.yourdomain.com`), which cannot be validated using HTTP/HTTPS methods.
- Doesn’t require server interaction or modification of web server configurations.

#### **Drawbacks**:
- Requires access to DNS management.
- DNS changes can take time to propagate, leading to longer validation times.
- Requires manual intervention unless using Certbot DNS plugins.

### **Summary of Validation Methods**:

| Validation Method | Web Server Required? | Configuration Needed | Suitable for Wildcard? | Downtime Required? |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Standalone        | No                   | None                 | No                     | Yes (Temporary)    |
| Webroot           | Yes                  | Webroot Directory    | No                     | No                 |
| DNS-01            | No                   | DNS TXT Record       | Yes                    | No                 |

Each method has its own use cases based on the environment and requirements. Standalone and webroot methods are commonly used for typical web servers, while DNS-01 is more flexible for advanced setups, especially for wildcard certificates.
