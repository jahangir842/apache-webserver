## SSL Installation from lets encrypt with certbot

To implement SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt on your Apache server, you can use the Certbot tool. Certbot automates the process of obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates for your Apache web server. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Install Certbot and the Apache Plugin  with Snap

Certbot recommends using their snap package for installation. Snap packages work on nearly all Linux distributions. To install `snapd` on your CentOS system, follow these steps:

1. **Install the `snapd` package On Rhel Based Linux**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install snapd
   ```
2. **Install the 'snapd on Amazon Linux:**

Even though the EPEL repository is not available for Amazon Linux 2023, you can still use Fedora repositories as alternatives because AL2023 and Fedora share a close relationship, and EPEL is a part of the Fedora Project.

Create a configuration file for the Fedora 36 repository:

   ```bash
   sudo touch /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo
   sudo nano /etc/yum.repos.d/fedora.repo
   ```
And write the following code in it:

   ```bash
   [fedora]
   name=Fedora 36 - $basearch
   #baseurl=http://download.example/pub/fedora/linux/releases/36/Everything/$basearch/os/
   metalink=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=fedora-36&arch=$basearch
   enabled=1
   metadata_expire=7d
   repo_gpgcheck=0
   type=rpm
   gpgcheck=1
   gpgkey=https://getfedora.org/static/fedora.gpg
          https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/fedora-repos/raw/f36/f/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-36-primary
   skip_if_unavailable=False
   ```
   Now install snapd with following command:
   
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install snapd
   ```

3. **Enable and start the `snapd.socket` systemd unit**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.socket
   ```

4. **Create a symbolic link for classic snap support**:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /var/lib/snapd/snap /snap
   ```

5. **Update the system paths**: 
   Restart your system to ensure the snap paths are updated correctly.

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```
   
### Removing Certbot Packages and Installing Certbot Snap

1. **Remove Existing Certbot Packages**

Before installing Certbot via snap, remove any existing Certbot packages installed through your OS package manager. This ensures that the `certbot` command uses the snap version rather than the OS package manager version. The command varies depending on your OS. Here are common examples:
   - For Debian-based systems (like Ubuntu):
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get remove certbot
     ```
   - For Fedora-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf remove certbot
     ```
   - For CentOS/RHEL-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo yum remove certbot
     ```

2. **Install Certbot Using Snap**

   Install Certbot with the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo snap install --classic certbot
   ```

3. **Prepare the Certbot Command**

   Create a symbolic link to ensure the `certbot` command is accessible:
   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
   ```

4. **Choose How to Run Certbot**

   - **To obtain and install certificates automatically**: Run the following command to get a certificate and automatically configure Apache to use it, enabling HTTPS in one step:
     ```bash
     sudo certbot --apache
     ```

**Note** Before running the above command ensure that the listed domains point to this Apache server are accessible from the internet otherwise the Certificate Authority will be failed to verify the temporary Apache configuration changes made by Certbot. Expected error: ```Certbot failed to authenticate some domains (authenticator: apache).```

   - **To obtain a certificate only**: If you prefer to manually configure Apache, use this command to get a certificate without automatic configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo certbot certonly --apache
     ```

5. **Test Automatic Renewal**

   Certbot includes a cron job or systemd timer for automatic certificate renewal. To test if automatic renewal is set up correctly, run:
   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

   Check the following locations to confirm the renewal process:
   - `/etc/crontab/`
   - `/etc/cron.*/*`
   - `systemctl list-timers`

6. **Verify Certificate Installation**

   Visit `https://yourwebsite.com/` in your browser and look for the lock icon in the URL bar to confirm that your site is using the new certificate.



### Step 5: (Optional) Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
Certbot can automatically set up redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, but if you need to do it manually, add the following to your Apache configuration:

1. Open your Apache configuration file for your site. It might be in `/etc/httpd/sites-available/yourdomain.conf` or similar.
2. Add the following:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName yourdomain.com
       ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
       Redirect permanent / https://yourdomain.com/
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

3. Restart Apache to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

Now your site should automatically redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and your SSL certificates will be managed by Let's Encrypt.
