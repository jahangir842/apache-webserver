In PHP, `$_REQUEST` is a superglobal array that contains data from both `$_GET` and `$_POST` requests, as well as `$_COOKIE`. It is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form or to handle URL query parameters.

In your PHP snippet:

```php
<?php
include "conf.php";
if ($_REQUEST['encrypted_text']) {
    echo secured_decrypt($_REQUEST['encrypted_text']);
}
```

### Breakdown:

1. **`include "conf.php";`**:
   - This line includes the file `conf.php`, which typically contains configuration settings or function definitions required for your script.

2. **`if ($_REQUEST['encrypted_text'])`**:
   - This checks if there is a value for the key `'encrypted_text'` in the `$_REQUEST` array. If `encrypted_text` is present (and not empty), the condition evaluates to true.

3. **`echo secured_decrypt($_REQUEST['encrypted_text']);`**:
   - If the condition is true, this line calls the function `secured_decrypt()` with the value of `'encrypted_text'` from `$_REQUEST` and outputs the result.

### Example Usage:

Suppose you have a form that submits data to this script:

```html
<form action="your_script.php" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="encrypted_text" value="example_encrypted_value">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

When the form is submitted, the value of the `encrypted_text` input field is sent to `your_script.php` using the `POST` method. The PHP script will then check if `$_REQUEST['encrypted_text']` is set and not empty, and if so, it will call `secured_decrypt()` on this value and print the result.

### Security Note:

Using `$_REQUEST` to directly access user input can be risky. It’s generally better to use `$_POST` or `$_GET` specifically to avoid unintended data being accessed. Additionally, ensure that the `secured_decrypt` function is implemented securely to avoid vulnerabilities like SQL injection or arbitrary code execution.

In PHP, `secured_decrypt()` is not a built-in function; it's a custom function that you would define in your code or include from another file, like `conf.php`. Typically, such functions are used to perform cryptographic operations, such as decrypting data that has been encrypted.

### Common Cryptographic Functions in PHP

Here’s an overview of commonly used cryptographic functions and practices in PHP:

#### 1. **Encryption and Decryption**

- **`openssl_encrypt()`**: Encrypts data using various algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- **`openssl_decrypt()`**: Decrypts data that was encrypted using `openssl_encrypt()`.

**Example:**
```php
$data = "secret data";
$key = "encryptionkey";

// Encrypt
$encrypted = openssl_encrypt($data, 'aes-256-cbc', $key, 0, $iv);
echo $encrypted;

// Decrypt
$decrypted = openssl_decrypt($encrypted, 'aes-256-cbc', $key, 0, $iv);
echo $decrypted;
```

- **`sodium_crypto_secretbox()`**: Provides authenticated encryption using the `libsodium` extension.

**Example:**
```php
$key = sodium_crypto_secretbox_keygen();
$nonce = random_bytes(SODIUM_CRYPTO_SECRETBOX_NONCEBYTES);
$encrypted = sodium_crypto_secretbox($data, $nonce, $key);

// Decrypt
$decrypted = sodium_crypto_secretbox_open($encrypted, $nonce, $key);
echo $decrypted;
```

#### 2. **Hashing**

- **`password_hash()`**: Hashes a password using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).

**Example:**
```php
$password = "userpassword";
$hash = password_hash($password, PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
```

- **`password_verify()`**: Verifies if a password matches a hash.

**Example:**
```php
if (password_verify($password, $hash)) {
    echo "Password is valid!";
} else {
    echo "Invalid password.";
}
```

- **`hash()`**: Provides a way to generate hashes using various algorithms (e.g., SHA-256).

**Example:**
```php
$data = "some data";
$hash = hash('sha256', $data);
```

#### 3. **Key Generation**

- **`random_bytes()`**: Generates cryptographically secure random bytes.

**Example:**
```php
$bytes = random_bytes(16);
```

#### 4. **Other Considerations**

- **Initialization Vectors (IVs)**: Used in encryption to ensure the same plaintext encrypts differently each time. Always use a unique IV for each encryption operation.
  
- **Key Management**: Ensure that cryptographic keys are stored securely and are not hard-coded in your scripts. Use environment variables or secure key management systems.

### Custom Functions

If `secured_decrypt()` is a custom function, it might look something like this:

```php
function secured_decrypt($encrypted_text) {
    $key = 'your-secret-key'; // Make sure to store this securely
    $iv = 'your-initialization-vector'; // Same IV used for encryption

    return openssl_decrypt($encrypted_text, 'aes-256-cbc', $key, 0, $iv);
}
```

In this example, `secured_decrypt()` is a wrapper around the `openssl_decrypt()` function, which decrypts data encrypted with AES-256-CBC.

Always ensure to follow best practices for encryption and hashing to maintain security in your applications.
