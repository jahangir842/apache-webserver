In PHP, `$_REQUEST` is a superglobal array that contains data from both `$_GET` and `$_POST` requests, as well as `$_COOKIE`. It is used to collect form data after submitting an HTML form or to handle URL query parameters.

In your PHP snippet:

```php
<?php
include "conf.php";
if ($_REQUEST['encrypted_text']) {
    echo secured_decrypt($_REQUEST['encrypted_text']);
}
```

### Breakdown:

1. **`include "conf.php";`**:
   - This line includes the file `conf.php`, which typically contains configuration settings or function definitions required for your script.

2. **`if ($_REQUEST['encrypted_text'])`**:
   - This checks if there is a value for the key `'encrypted_text'` in the `$_REQUEST` array. If `encrypted_text` is present (and not empty), the condition evaluates to true.

3. **`echo secured_decrypt($_REQUEST['encrypted_text']);`**:
   - If the condition is true, this line calls the function `secured_decrypt()` with the value of `'encrypted_text'` from `$_REQUEST` and outputs the result.

### Example Usage:

Suppose you have a form that submits data to this script:

```html
<form action="your_script.php" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="encrypted_text" value="example_encrypted_value">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

When the form is submitted, the value of the `encrypted_text` input field is sent to `your_script.php` using the `POST` method. The PHP script will then check if `$_REQUEST['encrypted_text']` is set and not empty, and if so, it will call `secured_decrypt()` on this value and print the result.

### Security Note:

Using `$_REQUEST` to directly access user input can be risky. Itâ€™s generally better to use `$_POST` or `$_GET` specifically to avoid unintended data being accessed. Additionally, ensure that the `secured_decrypt` function is implemented securely to avoid vulnerabilities like SQL injection or arbitrary code execution.
