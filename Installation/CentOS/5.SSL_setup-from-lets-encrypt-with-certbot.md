To implement SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt on your Apache server, you can use the Certbot tool. Certbot automates the process of obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates for your Apache web server. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

### Step 1: Install Certbot and the Apache Plugin
On Rocky Linux, Certbot can be installed from the EPEL repository.

1. **Enable the EPEL repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install epel-release
   ```

2. **Install Certbot and the Apache plugin:**
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install certbot python3-certbot-apache
   ```

### Step 2: Obtain an SSL Certificate
You can use Certbot to obtain an SSL certificate for your domain.

1. **Run Certbot:**
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --apache
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Certbot will ask for your email address for renewal notifications.
   - Agree to the terms of service.
   - Certbot will detect your Apache configuration and list the domains it finds. Select the appropriate domain(s) for which you want to enable SSL.
   - Certbot will automatically obtain and install the SSL certificate for the selected domains.

### Step 3: Verify the SSL Certificate
After Certbot completes, it will automatically configure Apache to use the new SSL certificate. 

1. **Restart Apache to apply changes:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

2. **Check your site:**
   Visit your site using `https://yourdomain.com`. The site should now be accessible over HTTPS with a valid SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt.

### Step 4: Auto-Renewal of Certificates
Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days, but Certbot will automatically renew them. To ensure the renewal process works, you can simulate a dry run:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

This command will check if the renewal process is functioning correctly.

### Step 5: (Optional) Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
Certbot can automatically set up redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, but if you need to do it manually, add the following to your Apache configuration:

1. Open your Apache configuration file for your site. It might be in `/etc/httpd/sites-available/yourdomain.conf` or similar.
2. Add the following:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName yourdomain.com
       ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com
       Redirect permanent / https://yourdomain.com/
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

3. Restart Apache to apply changes:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

Now your site should automatically redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS, and your SSL certificates will be managed by Let's Encrypt.
