To configure the firewall on CentOS (or Rocky Linux) for your Apache web server, you can use `firewalld`, which is the default firewall management tool. Below are the steps to open the necessary ports and configure the firewall.

### **1. Check Firewall Status**

First, check if `firewalld` is active and running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```

If the firewall is not active, you can start it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

Enable it to start on boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable firewalld
```

### **2. Open HTTP and HTTPS Ports**

Apache uses port `80` for HTTP and port `443` for HTTPS. You need to open these ports to allow web traffic through the firewall.

#### **Open HTTP Port (80)**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
```

#### **Open HTTPS Port (443)**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
```

#### **Reload the Firewall**

After making changes, reload the firewall to apply the new rules:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### **3. Verify Firewall Rules**

You can verify that the ports are open by listing the current firewall rules:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --list-all
```

You should see `http` and `https` listed under `services`.

### **4. Additional Firewall Configuration**

If you need to configure additional firewall rules, such as allowing access from specific IP addresses or opening other ports, you can use the following commands:

- **Allow a specific IP address**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-source=192.168.1.100
  ```

- **Open a specific port (e.g., port 8080)**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8080/tcp
  ```

- **Block a specific IP address**:
  
  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule="rule family='ipv4' source address='192.168.1.100' reject"
  ```

After making any of these changes, don’t forget to reload the firewall:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### **5. Disable or Remove Firewall Rules (Optional)**

If you need to remove or disable any previously added firewall rules, you can do so with the following commands:

- **Remove a service** (e.g., HTTPS):

  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=https
  ```

- **Remove a specific port** (e.g., port 8080):

  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-port=8080/tcp
  ```

- **Reload the firewall** to apply changes:

  ```bash
  sudo firewall-cmd --reload
  ```

### **Summary**
You’ve now configured the firewall to allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic for your Apache web server. This ensures that users can access your website securely. By managing firewall rules with `firewalld`, you can easily control network traffic to and from your server, enhancing its security.
