Yes, you can manually obtain and install SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt without using Certbot. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

You need to have `git`, `curl`, `openssl`, and `Apache` installed on your server.

```bash
sudo dnf install git curl openssl
```

### Step 2: Download the Let's Encrypt ACME Client

Let's Encrypt uses the ACME protocol to issue certificates. You can use the [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) client, which is a lightweight alternative to Certbot.

1. **Clone the `acme.sh` repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh.git
   cd acme.sh
   ```

2. **Install `acme.sh`:**
   ```bash
   ./acme.sh --install
   ```

3. **Add `acme.sh` to your path:**
   ```bash
   alias acme.sh=~/.acme.sh/acme.sh
   ```

### Step 3: Obtain the SSL Certificate

1. **Issue the certificate for your domain:**

   Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.

   ```bash
   acme.sh --issue --apache -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
   ```

   - The `--apache` flag tells `acme.sh` to use Apache to handle the challenge validation.
   - You can include additional `-d` flags for other subdomains.

2. **Certificate files:**

   After the command completes, your certificates will be located in `~/.acme.sh/yourdomain.com/`.

### Step 4: Install the SSL Certificate

Now that you have your certificates, you need to configure Apache to use them.

1. **Copy the certificates to a permanent location:**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssl/yourdomain.com/
   sudo cp ~/.acme.sh/yourdomain.com/fullchain.cer /etc/ssl/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
   sudo cp ~/.acme.sh/yourdomain.com/yourdomain.com.key /etc/ssl/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
   ```

2. **Edit your Apache configuration:**

   Open your Apache configuration file for your site, typically located in `/etc/httpd/sites-available/yourdomain.conf` or `/etc/httpd/conf.d/yourdomain.conf`.

   Add the following SSL configuration:

   ```apache
   <VirtualHost *:443>
       ServerName yourdomain.com
       ServerAlias www.yourdomain.com

       DocumentRoot /var/www/html/yourdomain

       SSLEngine on
       SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
       SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem

       <Directory /var/www/html/yourdomain>
           Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks
           AllowOverride All
       </Directory>
   </VirtualHost>
   ```

3. **Enable SSL module and restart Apache:**

   Ensure that SSL is enabled in Apache:

   ```bash
   sudo a2enmod ssl
   sudo systemctl restart httpd
   ```

### Step 5: Auto-Renewal Script

Since certificates from Let's Encrypt are only valid for 90 days, you should set up automatic renewal.

1. **Create a renewal script:**

   Create a simple script that renews the certificates:

   ```bash
   nano ~/renew_cert.sh
   ```

   Add the following content:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ~/.acme.sh/acme.sh --renew -d yourdomain.com --force --apache
   systemctl restart httpd
   ```

2. **Make the script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/renew_cert.sh
   ```

3. **Set up a cron job to run this script:**

   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

   Add the following line to run the script twice a month:

   ```bash
   0 0 1,15 * * ~/renew_cert.sh
   ```

### Step 6: Verify Installation

- Visit your site using `https://yourdomain.com`. You should see the SSL lock icon in your browser's address bar.
- Use an SSL checker to verify that the certificate is correctly installed.

This method requires more manual steps than using Certbot, but it gives you more control over the process.
